an electric field that decreases with
altitude. Near the surface of the earth,
the field is about \( 100 V m^{-1} . \) Why then
do we not get an electric shock as we
step out of our house into the open?
(Assume the house to be a steel cage so
there is no field inside!)
(b) A man fixes outside his house one evening a two metre high insulating slab
carrying on its top a large aluminium sheet
of area \( 1 m^{2} \). Will he get an electric shock if
he touches the metal sheet next morning?
(c) The discharging current in the atmosphere due to the small conductivity of
air is known to be 1800 A on an average
Over the globe. Why then does the atmosphere not discharge itself completely
in due course and become electrically
neutral? In other words, what keeps the atmosphere charged?
(d) What are the forms of energy into which the electrical energy of the atmosphere is dissipated during a lightning?
(Hint: The earth has an electric field of
about \( 100 \mathrm{Vm}^{-1} \) at its surface in the
downward direction, corresponding to a Surface charge density \( =-10^{-9} \mathrm{Cm}^{-2} \). Due
to the slight conductivity of the atmosphere
up to about \( 50 \mathrm{km} \) (beyond which it is
good conductor), about \( +1800 \mathrm{C} \) is pumped every second into the earth as a whole. The earth, however, does not get discharged since thunderstorms and lightning occurring continually allover the globe pump an equal amount of negative charge on the earth.)",Physics
